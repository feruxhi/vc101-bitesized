# VC101 Bite-sized 

VC101 Bite-sized is a simple web-app that lets anyone learn about Venture Capital in 10 minutes.

Problem: I haven't found a platform to host an online course that fit how I wanted to share learning content on the subject.

Solution: I wrote the content and built the v1 for a web app.
